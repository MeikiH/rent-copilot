# Platform Logos

Place your platform logos in this directory with the following naming convention:

- `wipimo.png` - Wipimo platform logo
- `x14.png` - X14 platform logo

## Logo Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG preferred (transparent background)
- **Size**: Recommended 200x200px minimum
- **Naming**: Use the platform slug as the filename

## Environment-specific Logos

Some platforms like Wipimo use CDN-based environment-specific logos. These are configured in the platform configuration and don't need to be stored here.

For platforms that use static logos, place them in this directory and reference them in the platform configuration `logoPath` field.
